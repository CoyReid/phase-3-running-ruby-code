# #this is a comment in ruby starting with a hashtag
# puts "Hello world!"

# #can also use parenthesis
# puts("Hello world! with parenthesis")

# #puts adds a line break, print does not
# puts "Hello world!"
# puts "Hello world!"
# puts "Hello world!"

# #using print does not have line break
# print "Hello World!"
# print "Hello World!"
# print "Hello World!"

# #using p is like using puts.something.inspect
# puts [1,2,3].inspect
# p [1,2,3]

# #then there is pretty printing, calls the .pretty_inspect method on data
# pp [{id: 1, hello: "world"}, {id: 2, hello:"ruby"}, {id: 3, hello:"moon"}, {id:4, hello: "learner"}]

puts "Hello World!"
